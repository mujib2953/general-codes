## pig-game :)

#### Game Play
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a **1** is rolled, or the player decides to **hold**:

- If the player rolls a **1**, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total, and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to **hold**, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

**The first player to score 100 or more points wins.**

##### Example
For example, the first player, _Donald_, begins a turn with a roll of **5**. _Donald_ could hold and score **5** points, but chooses to roll again. _Donald_ rolls a **2**, and could **hold** with a turn total of **7** points, but chooses to roll again. _Donald_ rolls a **1**, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, _Alexis_, rolls the sequence **4-5-3-5-5**, after which she chooses to **hold**, and adds her turn total of **22** points to her score.

I have completed very basic **pig-game**, with all basic requirements. I play with this more often, and it is working fine. If you find any flaw or bug please raise it, I would love to rectify this. 

And Yes, I wish I could upgrade the game to next level with below TODOs :)

##### TODOs

- [ ] Add Animation to dice rolling
- [ ] Add informative messages like game stated, player 1s turn, you roll 0 now your turn ends etc.
- [ ] Ask users name so that instead of player1 or player2 we can show their name
- [ ] Add some audio effects for rolling dice, winner celebration, sad sound effect for loosing turn
- [ ] Maintain a list of winner with their timings
